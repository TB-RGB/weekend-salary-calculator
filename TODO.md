## Requirements:

* This application should have a form with five inputs that collect a new employee's *first name, last name, ID number, job title, annual salary*.

* When the "Submit" button is clicked:
    * A new employee row should be added to the table.
    * The footer's total monthly cost should be updated.
    * The form inputs should be cleared out.

* If the total monthly cost **exceeds $20,000**, apply an `over-budget` CSS class to the footer element.
    * When applied, this CSS class should provide a clear visual indication that the monthly cost has been exceeded. (This could be as simple as turning the footer text red.)

* Create a "Delete" button that removes an employee from the DOM.
    * **For base mode**, the total monthly cost **does not** need to be updated when an employee is deleted.


Test Requirements
* Your form's submit button **must** have a `data-testid="submitButton"` attribute. Like so:
  * ```html
    <button data-testid="submitButton">
      Submit
    </button>
    ```
* Your form's inputs must have these exact attributes:
    * `data-testid="firstNameInput"`
    * `data-testid="lastNameInput"`
    * `data-testid="idInput"`
    * `data-testid="titleInput"`
    * `data-testid="annualSalaryInput"`
* You must use a `<table>` element, where each employee is represented by a single `<tr>`.
* The *total monthly* cost must be rendered somewhere inside the `<footer>` element.
* The `over-budget` CSS class must be applied to the `<footer>` element when the total monthly salary exceeds $20,000.
